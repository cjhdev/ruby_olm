Changes in `3.0.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.3.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes the following changes to 2.3.0:

* Support for building using cmake. Thanks to Konstantinos Sideris.
* Add more functions for managing private keys in the public key decryption
  functionality. These are meant for use with server-side encrypted key
  backups.  The new functions are ``olm_pk_private_key_length``,
  ``olm_pk_key_from_private``, and ``olm_pk_get_private_key``.
* ``olm_pk_generate_key`` and ``olm_pk_generate_key_random_length`` are
  deprecated: to generate a random key, use ``olm_pk_key_from_private``
  with random bytes as the private key.

Python wrapper:

* BREAKING CHANGE: This release introduces a new API for the Python wrapper,
  thanks to Damir Jelić.  The new API should be much easier to use for Python
  developers.  However, this means that existing code will need to be rewritten
  to use the new API.

JavaScript wrapper:

* BREAKING CHANGE: Olm now uses WebAssembly which means it needs
  to load the wasm file asynchronously, and therefore needs to be
  started up asynchronously. The imported module now has an init()
  method which returns a promise. The library cannot be used until
  this promise resolves. It will reject if the library fails to start.
* Using ``olm/olm.js`` will use the WebAssembly version of the library.  For
  environments that do not support WebAssembly, use ``olm/olm_legacy.js``.

Objective-C wrapper:

* Add support for the public key encryption/decryption functionality.

Changes in `2.3.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.3.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes the following changes since 2.2.2:

* Support building on Windows. Thanks to Marcel Radzio.
* Avoid C99 inside C++ code. Thanks to Alexey Rusakov.
* Support building as a static library. Thanks to Andreas Zwinkau.

New functionality:

* Add a number of methods for public key encryption and decryption. This
  functionality is meant for use with allowing virus scanning of encrypted
  attachments, server-side encrypted key backups, and possibly other uses. The
  methods are listed in the ``olm/pk.h`` header file. Corresponding wrappers
  are available in the JavaScript and Android wrappers. Objective-C and Python
  wrappers will be available in a future release.

Android wrapper:

* Update build tool dependencies
* Apply some hardening flags and fix some compilation and run-time issues.
  Thanks in part to Arnaud Fontaine.

Objective-C wrapper:

* Update project file
* Fix compiler warnings

Python wrapper:

* Add binding for ``olm_remove_one_time_keys``. Thanks to Wilfried Klaebe.
* Add utility module for ``ed25519_verify``. Thanks to Alexander Maznev.
* Improve portability. Thanks to Jan Jancar.

Changes in `2.2.2 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.2.2>`_
===============================================================

Objective-C wrapper:

* Fixed type of ``messageIndex`` argument in
  ``exportSessionAtMessageIndex``. Thanks to Greg Hughes.

Changes in `2.2.1 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.2.1>`_
===============================================================

The only change in this release is a fix to the build scripts for the
Objective-C wrapper which made it impossible to release the 2.2.0 CocoaPod.

Changes in `2.2.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.2.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes the following changes since 2.1.0:

* Add Java wrappers to allow use under Android.

New functionality:

* Add a number of methods allowing InboundGroupSessions to be exported and
  imported. These are: ``olm_inbound_group_session_first_known_index``,
  ``olm_export_inbound_group_session_length``,
  ``olm_export_inbound_group_session``, ``olm_import_inbound_group_session``
  and ``olm_inbound_group_session_is_verified``. Corresponding wrappers are
  available in the Javascript, Python, Objective-C and Android wrappers.

Objective-C wrapper:

* Fix a number of issues with the build scripts which prevented it being used
  for macOS/Swift projects. Thanks to Avery Pierce.

Changes in `2.1.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.1.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes the following changes since 2.0.0:

* Add OLMKit, the Objective-C wrapper. Thanks to Chris Ballinger for the
  initial work on this.

Javascript wrapper:

* Handle exceptions during loading better (don't leave a half-initialised
  state).
* Allow applications to tune emscripten options (such as the amount of heap).
* Allocate memory for encrypted/decrypted messages on the empscripten heap,
  rather than the stack, allowing more efficient memory use.


Changes in `2.0.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=2.0.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes the following changes since 1.3.0:

* Fix a buffer bounds check when decoding group messages.
* Update ``olm_group_decrypt`` to return the ratchet index for decrypted
  messages.
* Fix ``olm_pickle_account``, ``olm_pickle_session``,
  ``olm_pickle_inbound_group_session`` and
  ``olm_pickle_outbound_group_session`` to correctly return the length of the
  pickled object.
* Add a `specification <./docs/megolm.rst>`_ of the Megolm ratchet, and add
  some information on mitigating unknown key-share attacks to the `Olm
  specification <./docs/olm.rst>`_.
* Add an ``install-headers`` target to the Makefile (and run it when installing
  the library). (Credit to Emmanuel Gil Peyrot).


Changes in `1.3.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=1.3.0>`_
===============================================================

This release updates the group session identifier to avoid collisions.
Group sessions are now identified by their ed25519 public key.

These changes alter the pickle format of outbound group sessions, attempting
to unpickle an outbound group session created with a previous version of olm
will give ``OLM_CORRUPTED_PICKLE``. Inbound sessions are unaffected.

This release alters the format of group session_key messages to include the
ratchet counter. The session_key messages are now self signed with their
ed25519 key. No attempt was made to preserve backwards-compatibility.
Attempting to send session_keys between old and new versions will give
``OLM_BAD_SESSION_KEY``.

Changes in `1.2.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=1.2.0>`_
===============================================================

This release updates the implementation of group session communications, to
include Ed25519 signatures on group messages, to ensure that participants in
group sessions cannot masquerade as each other.

These changes necessitate changes to the pickle format of inbound and outbound
group sessions, as well as the session_keys exchanged between them. No attempt
has been made to preserve backwards-compatibility:

* Attempting to restore old pickles will give ``OLM_CORRUPTED_PICKLE``.
* Attempting to send session_keys between old and new versions will give
  ``OLM_BAD_SESSION_KEY``.
* Attempting to send messages between old and new versions will give one of a
  number of errors.

There were also a number of implementation changes made as part of this
release, aimed at making the codebase more consistent, and to help with the
implementation of the group message signatures.


Changes in `1.1.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=1.1.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes a fix to a bug which caused Ed25519 keypairs to be
generated and used insecurely. Any Ed25519 keys generated by libolm 1.0.0
or earlier should be considered compromised.

The fix necessitates a change to the format of the OlmAccount pickle; since
existing OlmAccounts should in any case be considered compromised (as above),
the library refuses to load them, returning OLM_BAD_LEGACY_ACCOUNT_PICKLE.


Changes in `1.0.0 <http://matrix.org/git/olm/commit/?h=1.0.0>`_
===============================================================

This release includes a fix to a bug which had the potential to leak sensitive
data to the application: see
https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web/issues/1719. Users of pre-1.x.x
versions of the Olm library should upgrade. Our thanks to `Dmitry Luyciv
<https://github.com/dluciv>`_ for bringing our attention to the bug.

Other changes since 0.1.0:

 * *Experimental* implementation of the primitives for group sessions. This
   implementation has not yet been used in an application and developers are
   advised not to rely on its stability.

 * Replace custom build scripts with a Makefile.

 * Include the major version number in the soname of libolm.so (credit to
   Emmanuel Gil Peyrot).
